Scrape Contracts Finder
=======================

Some UK public sector contracts are published on [Contracts Finder](https://www.contractsfinder.service.gov.uk/).

This uses [the Contracts Finder API](https://www.contractsfinder.service.gov.uk/apidocumentation/V2) to pull all the available records into a CSV file.

Install the dependencies with `npm install`, then run `node contracts-finder`. Produces a file named `contracts-finder.csv`.
