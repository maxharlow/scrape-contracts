Scrape Contracts

The [Cabinet Office] (https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/cabinet-office) run [Contracts Finder] (https://www.contractsfinder.businesslink.gov.uk/), which lists contracts with the government worth over Â£10,000 -- both tendered and awarded. This scrapes both those sets of records into CSVs.

Requires [SBT] (http://www.scala-sbt.org/) and the JDK.

Run with `sbt run`.
